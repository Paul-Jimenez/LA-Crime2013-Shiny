#Visualizing LAâ€™s 2013 Crime Through Shiny

I used data found [here](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/LAPD-Crime-and-Collision-Raw-Data-for-2013/iatr-8mqm) to make a shiny app to visualize LA crime data for 2013. The app can be found [here](https://paul-jimenez.shinyapps.io/LA-CRIME/) and features a navigation bar and various filters.
